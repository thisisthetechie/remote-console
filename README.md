## Getting Started
The first thing I needed was a laptop (in this case, an old 32-bit Dell Inspiron Mini 10) with a working Linux install. 
If you want to enable GUI, then go ahead. My installation was all CLI.

I think the very first thing I was forced to do was install the drivers for the Wireless LAN interface, which is an old complaint about Linux.
I won't go into that installation, as it may not be relevant to everyone. If there are any requests, I can write that up as another article. 

_My linux of choice is Debian so all commands may differ on your own distribution of choice, if you have any questions please ask away_
